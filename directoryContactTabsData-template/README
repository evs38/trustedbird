Directory Contact Tabs (Data)
-----------------------------

This add-on contains no panels.
It can be used to package panels (tabs) for the "Directory Contact Tabs (Engine)" add-on.

Panels are defined with XUL files.


In order to package new panel(s):

Step 1 - choose a new package name (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, without spaces)

Step 2 - replace all instances of the "DCT_PACKAGE_NAME" string by the package name in the following files:
- install.rdf
- chrome.manifest
- defaults/preferences/default.js

Step 3 - add .xul file(s) in the directory chrome/content/
         *.dtd should go in the sub-directories chrome/locale/*/
         *.css should go in the directory chrome/skin/

Step 4 - register the panels by editing the file defaults/preferences/default.js

Step 5 - zip the add-on directory (root must be where install.rdf is located) and name the zip file with the ".xpi" extension
