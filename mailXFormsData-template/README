Mail XForms Data
----------------

This add-on contains no form. It can be used to package your own forms.

== How to create a new "Mail XForms Data" add-on with your forms ==

Step 1 - choose a new package name (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, without spaces)

Step 2 - replace all instances of the "MXD_PACKAGE_NAME" string by the package name in the following files:
- install.rdf
- chrome.manifest
- defaults/preferences/default.js

Step 3 - add the new form file(s) (*.xul or *.xhtml) in the directory chrome/content/

Step 4 - register the forms by editing the file defaults/preferences/default.js

Step 5 - zip the add-on directory (root must be where install.rdf is located) and name the zip file with the extension "xpi"



This add-on for Mozilla Thunderbird 3 contains forms for the "Mail XForms Engine" add-on.
Forms are XHTML or XUL files with XForms elements.
