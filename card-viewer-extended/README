Card Viewer Extended
--------------------

This add-on for Mozilla Thunderbird adds a button in address book cards to fetch and display the certificate of a contact. For a local address book, the certificate is taken from the local certificate store and for a LDAP directory, it's fetched from the LDAP server. The key used to retrieve the certificate is the email address of the contact.

This add-on is written in XUL and Javascript.
